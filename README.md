# fallout4_improved.nvim
My take on a fallout 4 improved theme for Neovim

Layout and logic based on the work of Pix-xiP over at [umbral](https://github.com/Pix-xiP/umbral.nvim) which is in turn based on the amazing work of folke over in [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) including the autoload functionality and the general theme layout ++ plugins colouring.
